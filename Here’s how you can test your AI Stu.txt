Hereâ€™s how you can test your AI Study Buddy Chrome Extension locally using the Origin Trial tokens and Chromeâ€™s built-in AI APIs:

âœ… 1. Prerequisites

Chrome version 131 to 138 (required for the APIs to work)

Check your version at chrome://version


Origin Trial tokens for:

localhost:443 (for local testing)
aistudybuddy.dev (for production)


Enable Developer Mode in Chrome Extensions


ðŸ§ª 2. Load the Extension


Unzip the file you downloaded:
ðŸ“¦ ai-study-buddy-chrome-extension.zip


Open Chrome and go to:
chrome://extensions


Enable Developer Mode (top right)


Click Load unpacked and select the unzipped folder



ðŸ§  3. Replace Origin Trial Tokens
In popup.html, replace the placeholder tokens with your actual ones:
HTML<meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="YOUR_PROMPT_API_TOKEN"><meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="YOUR_SUMMARIZER_API_TOKEN"><meta http-equiv="origin-trial" content="YOUR_PROOFREADER_API_TOKEN">Show more lines
You can include both localhost and aistudybuddy.dev tokens if needed.
